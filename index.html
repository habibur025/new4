            <p>I am ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI based on the GPT-4 architecture. My training
                involved
                large amounts of text data, allowing me to assist with a range of tasks like answering questions,
                providing
                explanations, generating text, and offering recommendations. I can engage in conversation, provide
                summaries,
                and perform various writing tasks. My design is focused on providing helpful, informative, and engaging
                interactions.</p>
